# elasticsearch-default-analyzers

This repository contains the "custom" definitions of the language analyzers
built into ElasticSearch, as defined in the documentation
[here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/configuring-analyzers.html).
This should provide a good starting point for anyone trying to customize
ElasticSearch language handling.
